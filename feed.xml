        <title>Upload to S3 using the Amazon Java SDK!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a 10 minute video I made a few months ago about how to use the AWS Java SDK to upload any type of data to S3. It is very easy. There are a few gotchas that I explain in depth. If you like this video or have feedback, leave me a comment on this page.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AWS Java SDK - DevOps Automation!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/IllinoisJUGNorthwest/events/228187464/&quot;&gt;presenting&lt;/a&gt; again! This time, I will build on my previous presentation and share my personal story of how AWS SDKs promote automation of infrastructure provision. Through my experience, I truly started believing that the old way of writing software, then having someone build it, and then having someone else deploy it, test it and finally have another party move it into production just will not work. That old way of doing things is just, simply, too slow. Too slow, too expensive and too far detached from customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/automation.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image showing a retro factory with boilers and pipes indicating automation.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consider disruption potential.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History shows that companies that move really fast on really small budgets are usually the disruptive force in an industry. A large undertaking with consensus driven, risk averse culture only enables incremental innovation while others try to disrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consider lean software enterprise.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basis of lean is in the ability to produce steady iterations of minimal innovative feature sets which allow the company to pivot or persevere. Will a long cycle SDLC process allow you to produce frequent iterations that can be A/B tested with customers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consider customer satisfaction.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers want service quickly, easily and continuously. Any bugs, performance problems, downtime is perceived by customers as poor customer service. How can a multi week production cycle help an enterprise fix a bug or improve performance? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DevOps Automation - what can it do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the basic level, DevOps Automation promises to reduce the time taken between writing a line of code and using it in production. In some enterprises, it can take up to 10 person years (yes, 10 person years). Regardless of how long it takes, most IT professionals are familiar with processes and gates that are ubiquitous in SDLC. Even as enterprises switch to agile methodology and automate many aspects of software development, they still depend on a large amount of manual work to test, move, deploy &amp;amp; operate software &amp;amp; infrastructure. With a good plan and a strategic shift in goals and cultural mindset, DevOps promises to automate all aspects - I mean all aspects - of taking software to production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AWS - SDK and Automation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com&quot;&gt;Amazon web services&lt;/a&gt; is built, from the core, for automation. Almost all aspects of infrastructure provisioning on AWS can be done with an API call. In most cases, a DevOps Engineer can chain API calls to provision dependent infrastructure and can also utilize third party tools such as Chef, Puppet or Ansible on AWS. AWS also has products that specifically are built for automating the build lifecycle. If DevOps is a key part of your game plan you will learn about how to take it to the next level. If you want to make DevOps the center of your IT strategy, this presentation will get you started. Do not miss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head over to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/IllinoisJUGNorthwest/events/228187464/&quot;&gt;IJUG - NW meetup site&lt;/a&gt; for registration and venue information!

        <title>AWS Certified!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The success of any AWS implementation inevitably depends on well communicated goals expressed in technical as well as commercial terms. Leaders tasked with transforming an IT organization must spend time and energy to communicate achievable targets, time frames and priorities throughout the organization. Who better to carry out this task then people whom Amazon Web Services certifies to be technically knowledgeable? To show my commitment to successful AWS implementations and to show solidarity with an IT leader&#39;s cause, I recently obtained the AWS Solutions Architect certification. This is just the first step in showcasing various levels of knowledge that Genvega and I can bring to the table for complex IT cloud projects. In future, I plan to take the AWS DevOps Engineer certification test. Watch this space!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Solutions-Architect-Associate.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image showing AWS Solutions Architect - Associate&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the AWS Solutions Architect Certification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/certification/&quot;&gt;certifications&lt;/a&gt; test the individual&#39;s ability to design, deploy and operate AWS infrastructure. In particular, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/&quot;&gt;AWS Solutions Architect certification&lt;/a&gt; tests the individual&#39;s ability to design fault tolerant, scalable systems using AWS. A Certified AWS Solutions Architect is able to analyze business requirements and select the most suitable and cost efficient system design suitable for the requirement. 
&lt;/p&gt;
